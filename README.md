# Programming_Notes
The objective of this repository is to keep notes of Programming language. As you learn many other languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and PHP, it is important that you have some notes, notes that have been practiced and typed by you, in order to be able to recall your skills when you come back to your previous language again in the future.   
# All The Best.
